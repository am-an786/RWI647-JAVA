Interpreter:-an Interpreter is a computer program that converts the high-level program statement into Assembly-level language. It converts the code into machine code when the program is run.

Roles of Java Interpreter

To convert the bytecode into the native code of the machine.
This process is done line by line.
If the error comes on any line, the process is stopped over there.
Interpreter vs Compiler: How is Interpreter Different Than a Compiler in Java?
Here are some key differences between an interpreter and a compiler. They are as follows:

The interpreter scans the program line by line and translates it into machine code whereas the compiler scans the entire program first and then translates it into machine code.
The interpreter shows one error at a time whereas the compiler shows all errors and warnings at the same time.
In the interpreter, the error occurs after scanning each line whereas, in the compiler, the error occurs after scanning the whole program.
In an interpreter, debugging is faster whereas, in the compiler, debugging is slow.
Execution time is more in the interpreter whereas execution time is less in the compiler.
An interpreter is used by languages such as Java, and Python, and the compiler is used by languages such as C, C++, etc.
